# API for Create Social Network using Node, GraphQL and MongoDB

To start the API separately `cd` into `api` folder and run `npm start` or `yarn start`. That will run the development server, which will reload automatically if you make changes to the code.

After running the server, you can navigate to `http://localhost:4000/graphql` where you can test the API using [GraphQL Playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/testing/graphql-playground/)
